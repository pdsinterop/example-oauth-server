# Building a resource server in PHP

This is series of articles describing how to implement an Authorization and 
Resource Server in PHP. It consists of multiple parts:

- 1. [Introduction](./01.introduction.md)
- 2. [Resource Server](./02.resource-server.md)
- 3. [Authorization](./03.authorization.md)
- 4. [Authentication](./04.authentication.md)
- 5. [Security Considerations](./05.security-considerations.md)

The articles were written using the experience gained working at [PDS Interop](https://pdsinterop.org),
implementing the standards that define a [Solid Server](solidproject.org/).

An example combining a client application, an authorization server, and a 
resource server, used in these articles, can be found at https://github/pdsinterop/oauth-example
