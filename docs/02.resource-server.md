## Part 2:Resource Server

It all starts with a resource.

For this example there are two resources the resource server should expose:

- **Public resource**<br/>
  A resource that is always available, no Authorization required.
- **Private resource**<br/>
  A resource that can only be accessed after a client or user has completed an
  authorization request.

Something that can only be accessed by a client  _after_ it has received
permission from a user to access it.

In order to see the resource or give access to a client, a user will have to be
logged in.

For an application to request the resource _without_ the user, it will need to
store the user's permission in the form of client credentials that can be used
independently later.

All of those things are not a concern to us yet, as we only need to worry about
resource for now.
